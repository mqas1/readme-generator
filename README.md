## Description
  
It is hard enough remembering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Full-stack web developers have enough to worry about and don’t need to add using Markdown to structure a README to that list. This command line application was created to aid developers in generating professional README files. All the heavy lifting is done for you… though knowing Markdown won’t hurt. It will help you use this application!

## Installation
  
Run the following commands: ```npm i inquirer@8.2.4``` and ```npm i dayjs```.
  
  
## Usage
  
The user runs the command ```node index.js``` and answers the prompts. The answers are used to populate the generated README. Markdown can be used but escape sequences such as ```\n``` will not work. The user can always go back and edit the generated file.
